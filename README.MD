# Discord E-Commerce Bot - EcommerceBot

EcommerceBot is a Node.js-based Discord bot with integrated e-commerce functionality powered by Stripe and MongoDB. The bot allows users to register, manage their profiles, purchase game subscriptions, upload files, and create/manage tickets for support. Designed for simplicity and efficiency, it provides tools for both users and administrators.

## Features

### User Commands:
1. **!register**
   - Registers a user with their Discord username and generates a secure password.
   - Displays credentials upon successful registration.

2. **!profile**
   - Shows the user's profile, including their role, subscriptions, and account details.

3. **!games**
   - Displays a list of available games and their subscription plans (e.g., 24-hour, 7-day, 30-day, and 365-day access).
   - Generates a Stripe purchase link for selected subscriptions.

4. **!support**
   - Creates a support ticket.
   - Allows users to set ticket priority (Low, Medium, High, Urgent).

### Admin Commands:
1. **!upload**
   - Uploads files related to a specific game.

2. **!creategame**
   - Adds new games to the list of available options.

3. **!ban / !unban**
   - Bans or unbans users from accessing the bot or specific functionalities.

4. **!sale**
   - Sets discounts for games.
   - Notifies all registered users of the sale via an embedded message.

5. **!motd**
   - Updates the message of the day (optional).

### Ticket Logic:
- Tracks the last response time for both admins and users.
- Periodically checks for open tickets and sends reminders to users if:
  - The admin has responded.
  - The user hasnâ€™t replied within 30 minutes.
  - No previous reminders were sent in the last 30 minutes.
- Prevents spam by updating reminder timestamps.

### Other Features:
- Automatically updates user roles after purchases.
- Sends notifications for game sales and updates.
